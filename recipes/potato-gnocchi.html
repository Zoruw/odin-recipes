        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Gnocchi</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot boil potatoes until tender, remove from the pot and let cool  remove the skin. Then pass through a potato ricer.</li>
            <li>Mix together the flour and salt and place on a flat surface, make a well in the middle and add the potatoes and egg, mix together with your fingers to form a soft dough, it should not stick to your fingers. On a lightly floured surface, cut small amounts of dough to form ropes and cut into 3/4 inch (2 cm) pieces, then slide each piece on a fork and squeeze a little (but not too hard). Sprinkle with a little bit of flour and toss, so they don't stick together. Let the gnocchi rest for 20 minutes before cooking.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Tomato sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>While the gnocchi are resting make the sauce.  In a large saucepan add olive oil, tomatoes, salt, garlic, oregano, basil, hot pepper flakes and water, stir to combine, half cover and let simmer over medium heat until thickened. Remove cover for the last few minutes to thicken. </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cooking Gnocchi</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water cook the gnocchi, gnocchi are ready when they float to the top.  Drain and add to the cooked sauce, add a little pasta water, cook for 30 seconds, gently tossing. Serve immediately topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
